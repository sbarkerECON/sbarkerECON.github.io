<h1>One sure way to determine if you are stupid</h1>
<p class="post-data">Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-02-10</span>.</p>
<p>Stupidity is defined as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Slow to learn or understand; obtuse.</li>
    <li>Tending to make poor decisions or careless mistakes.</li>
    <li>Marked by a lack of intelligence or care; foolish or careless.</li>
</ul>
<p>One sure way to determine if what you're doing is stupid is <strong>if you do what you do, or say what you say, because that is what the majority is doing!</strong></p>
<p>Here are some examples of sayings that reveal utter stupidity:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Since most major Linux distributions has adopted systemd, then surely systemd cannot be bad.</li>
    <li>Clearly Linux is more popular than BSD, hence it must be better.</li>
    <li>It's the "modern way" of doing things, everyone does it, I will do it too!</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, you're stupid or naive or both if you follow what the majority does, just because it is the majority!</p>
<p>The majority has never, not even once - in the entire history of mankind - been any indication of what is right or correct.</p>
<blockquote>
    Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to reform (or pause and reflect).<br><br>-- Mark Twain
</blockquote>
<p>You need to think independently and be brave enough to go against what the majority is saying or doing, even if that makes you stand all alone. The truth never take sides. Either you're right, or you're wrong. Make sure that if you're wrong, you're wrong because you made an honest mistake, and not because you disconnected your brain and let others think for you!</p>
