<h1>FreeBSD 13 has been released, kudos to all involved!</h1>
<p class="post-data">Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-04-14</span>.</p>
<p class="info info-yellow abstract">This is great news. A lot of work has been put into the release of FreeBSD 13 and the system has never been as good as it is now.</p>
<p>The release was announced <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/releases/13.0R/announce/">yesterday</a> and as soon as I got the release update on email I hurriedly upgraded one of my storage machines from 12.2 to 13.</p>
<p>I had been following the development and work that went into FreeBSD 13 and was looking forward to upgrading ZFS with the new features from <a href="https://openzfs.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenZFS</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of work has been put into this <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/releases/13.0R/relnotes/">release</a> and it is difficult to fully express the gratitude one should have towards the people involved. This goes for all open and free projects of course.</p>
<p>It is easy to forget just how much hard work and effort that goes into projects like FreeBSD, and I have seen many people complain about this or that, and then afterwards even threaten to "not use this operating system anymore", like if they stopped using the system it will somehow harm the project or the developers!</p>
<p>It's utter ridicules because the people who often makes these stupid "threats" are using the system completely free, and they are in most cases not contributing anything at all, neither work nor money. Yet, they somehow believe that if they stop using the product it will effect the project negatively!?</p>
<p>On the contrary, people who behave like this will do everyone a great favor by not using the product at all because all they do is to whine and complain and make demands.</p>
<p>Anyway, as seen in the <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/releases/13.0R/relnotes/">release notes</a> many new features have been developed and implemented and I would just like to say <strong>kudos</strong> to all involved!</p>
