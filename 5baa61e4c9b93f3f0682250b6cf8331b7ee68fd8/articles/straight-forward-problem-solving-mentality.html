<h1>Straight forward problem solving mentality</h1>
<p class="post-data">Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-04-01</span>.</p>
<p class="info info-yellow abstract">In my last couple of articles I have been talking about the problems with object oriented programming theory and implementation, and I have been talking about the problems with frantic focusing on software testing. In this article I'm almost not going to say anything, I'll just recommend a really good talk for you :)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.abnercoimbre.com/#about">Abner Coimbre</a> was only 23 years old when he worked at the Kennedy Space Center at NASA, when he made this video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzc3HcIgXis">What programming is never about</a>.</p>

<p>Despite his young age at the time, he very quickly realized what true software development is actually about: To acquire a straight forward problem solving mentality and not care too much about all the theory and best practices.</p>

<blockquote>It is precisely because the problems I help solve are significant that I learned, right here at NASA, that the code and "how it looks" is not priority, but rather what you did with it (Abner Coimbre).</blockquote>

<p>Get yourself a cup of coffee or tea and relax for about 43 minutes while watching this great talk!</p>
