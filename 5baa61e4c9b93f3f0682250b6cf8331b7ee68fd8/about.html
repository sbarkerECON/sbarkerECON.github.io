<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>Born in the 70th, yet ageless, and this is the place where I occasionally share my notes, thoughts and tutorials about open source, BSD and GNU/Linux system administration, and programming - the pragmatic way.</p>
<p>Please forgive any shortcomings and mistakes on this website. Also, English is not my native language.</p>
<p>I started programming in BASIC on the <a href="sharp-mz-800.html">Sharp MZ-800</a> when I was about 9 or 10 and I have been passionately interested in computers and programming since then. :)</p>
<p>I had my first computer related job when I was only 15 years old in a security and communications company working primarily with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem">modems</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE2">10BASE2</a> Ethernet systems. There I learned a lot about soldering, electronics, and programming in machine code. It was a real dream job for a 15 year old kid. :)</p>
<p>I almost became an electronic engineer, but I never finished the last part of my studies because I was too busy working. Therefore I am mostly self-taught.</p>
<p>Most of my life I have been working as a system and network administrator and programmer, both as an employee and as a freelancer/consultant.</p>
<p>I am a passionate proponent of open source, and of making systems simple, clear, secure and very performant.</p>
<p>I am absolutely <strong>allergic</strong> to applications and system setups that have been put together by following hype and trends.</p>
<p>Whenever I am involved in a project I try to follow good software engineering principles such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Simplicity</b>: The system should always be as simple and small as possible. When software projects grow, so do errors and bugs. Techniques such as line-by-line inspection of software, relevant unit testing, and physical examination of hardware that implements protection mechanisms are great. For such techniques to be successful a small and simple design is essential. This is sometimes described as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> principle and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren&#x27;t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a>.</li>
<li><b>Least privilege</b>: Each user and program should operate using the fewest privileges possible.</li>
<li><b>Open design</b>: In order for a system to be secure it must never depend on attacker ignorance. Instead the design should be based upon technology that depend upon public scrutiny - whenever possible.</li>
<li><b>Complete mediation</b>: Every access attempt must be checked and validated.</li>
<li><b>Easy to use</b>: The human interface must be as easy and intuitive to use as possible. Easy and simple is always better than smart and fancy. Simple user testing is a great way to get valuable feedback.</li>
<li><b>Usability</b>: Well known usability standards should be met if required.</li>
<li><b>Discrimination</b>: User discrimination is never good. User discrimination is when an application only works for a very limited amount of systems, like when a website only works with JavaScript enabled even though it doesn't provide any functionality that really requires JavaScript.</li>
<li><b>Documentation</b>: Lacking or inadequate documentation is a bug. Everything needs to be adequately documented from the very beginning, it is an integrate part of software development. I strongly <strong>abhor</strong> poor or lacking documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am also the author of <a href="https://phpthewrongway.com/">PHP The Wrong Way</a>, <a href="https://openbsdrouterguide.net/">OpenBSD Router Guide</a> and <a href="programmering-i-go/">Programmering i Go</a> (a Danish Go programming tutorial that I hope I have the time to finish some day).</p>
<p>I don't use social media so you can't find me there. I currently do have an account on <a href="https://github.com/unixsheikh/">GitHub</a>, but I rarely have an opportunity to put stuff on there.</p>

<h2 id="sheikh">Why the "sheikh" part in the domain?</h2>
<p>Just for fun.</p>
<p>The word "sheikh" is an honorific title in the Arabic language. The word in Arabic stems from the triliteral root connected with age and aging: ش-ي-خ, shin-ya-kha. The title carries the meaning leader, elder, or noble.</p>
