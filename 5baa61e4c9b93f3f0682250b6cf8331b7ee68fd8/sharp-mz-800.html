<h2>Flappy</h2>
<p>Flappy was my first computer game on the Sharp MZ-800 and it is still today one of my favorite games :)</p>
<p><img src="includes/images/flappy-cover.jpg" alt="Flappy cover"></p>
<p>Flappy is a puzzle game by dB-Soft that features a somewhat mole-like character who must complete each level by pushing a blue stone from its starting place to the blue tile destination. Flappy first appeared on the Sharp X1 home computer in 1983 but was soon followed by conversions to a number of popular Japanese computers in the early 1980s, including the Sharp MZ-800.</p>

<p>A really good Java clone of the old 8bit Flappy game can be downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/flappy/">sourceforge</a></p>
<p>And a complete playlist with gameplay of all 100 levels of Flappy on Sharp MZ-800 is played by Petr Diblík on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL31EF8374A65064B0">YouTube</a>. Unfortunatly there is no sound on the videos by Petr, but a level 1 gameplay with sound can be found played by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gn9DnzTdc">Tompika74</a>.</p>
