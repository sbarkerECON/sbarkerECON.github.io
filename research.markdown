      <h3>The Measurement and Technology of Human Capital using Course Grades: A Factor Model in Network Data (JMP)</h3>
      <p class="authors"><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Barker </p>
      <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
      This paper develops theory and methods to recover human capital from
      course grades while allowing for selection and grading heterogeneity and
      then estimates the technology of human capital accumulation emphasizing
      the role of high school teachers. The reliance on standardized test
      scores implicitly shapes the scope, methods, and study populations of
      research in ways that may bias empirical results and create blind spots
      for policy. By identifying and estimating the measurement system of
      course grades, this paper facilitates education and human capital
      research without resorting to over-testing or raw grades which can cause
      bias. I model course grades using a factor model and characterize
      sufficiency conditions for identification in terms of the connectivity of
      the network using graph theory. Using this measurement innovation, I then
      recover teacher effects in non-tested subjects and grades in high school.
      This advances two frontier topics in the value-added space and improves
      the representation of teachers and vulnerable populations of students,
      like high school dropouts, who are central to policy but frequently have
      missing test scores.
